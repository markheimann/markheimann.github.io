<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div class="blurb">
  <p>
    Role discovery in networks—i.e., finding nodes that have similar functions, ties or interactions with nodes in other positions, irrespective of their proximity or reachability in the network—has received decades of study in quantitative sociology and has subsequently become a fundamental problem in graph  data mining. Recently, network embedding methods have been developed to model the structural roles of nodes in latent feature space, leveraging the power of representation learning for role discovery. In this tutorial, we will review the formalisms of structural roles in networks using techniques from network science and social science, and cover many existing node embedding methods to analyze the extent to which their technical objectives make them capable of discerning these structural roles. We will present common pitfalls in the evaluation of structural embedding methods, and comprehensive evaluation methodology to overcome  those and characterize the strengths and weaknesses of different embedding methods both in synthetic, controlled settings and real-world applications. The applications will span a single network and across multiple networks, including a large-scale industrial case study. Finally, we will introduce an extendable, public network embedding library we have developed to allow for easy use of many structural embedding methods, giving attendees a hands-on opportunity to try out what they have learned.
