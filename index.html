    I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/casc">Center for Applied Scientific Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>.  In 2020, I received my PhD in computer science from the <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>, where I was a member of the <a href="https://gemslab.github.io/">GEMS Lab</a> and advised by <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra">Danai Koutra</a>. During my PhD I also completed research internships at the <a href="https://www.isi.edu/">Information Sciences Institute</a>, <a href="https://research.adobe.com/">Adobe Research</a> and <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>.  I completed my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a> in 2015.

<p>
    My research interests are in data mining methods for large graphs or networks.  During my PhD, I developed node embedding methods that capture structural roles of nodes in networks, along with principled and scalable formulations for graph mining problems such as network alignment and classification that are defined over multiple networks.  You can read more about my work in technical detail in my <a href="papers/20Thesis.pdf">dissertation</a>, or more quickly consult a conceptual confectionary conspectus in my <a href="assets/project_figs/dessertation.png">dessertation</a> :)  I am also interested in methodological connections and applications to natural language processing and the social and natural sciences.
