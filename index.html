    <p>I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Michigan working in the <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/group/index.html">GEMS Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra">Danai Koutra</a>. Specifically, my current research interests include algorithmic methods for speeding up large matrix-based data mining and machine learning problems, as well as representation learning in networks. 

    <p>Other significant pursuits of mine include chess, where I am an active competitive player with the master title in both the United States Chess Federation and FIDE, and music.  I am interested in creating artificial intelligence technology for music analysis and performance, as well as the design and use of electronic effects especially for augmenting acoustic instruments. </p>
