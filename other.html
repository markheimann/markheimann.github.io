Outside of computer science I have the chance to participate in many activitites.  I am thankful for the lessons I've learned, the memorable experiences I've had, and the gracious and talented people I have come to know through each of them.

I hold the titles of <a href="http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?12802899">USCF Senior Master</a> and <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/card.phtml?event=2028441">FIDE Master</a>, the highest rating-based national and international titles awarded in chess, respectively.  Over the course of my competitive career, I have won several national scholastic titles and state open titles, as well as national collegiate team titles from my years playing chess for the WUSTL and U of M collegiate chess teams.  In the 2018 and 2019 <a href="https://www.prochessleague.com/">PRO Chess League</a> seasons, I played for the <a href="https://www.prochessleague.com/pittsburgh-pawngrabbers.html">Pittsburgh Pawngrabbers</a>; our team made the playoffs in 2018.  In 2020, I also played first board for the Michigan team that made it to the finals of the inaugural online <a href="https://stateschesscup.wordpress.com/">States Chess Cup</a>.  For several years I also taught chess in private and group lessons, organizing intensive chess camps as well as after-school programs.

<h2>Powerlifting</h2>
<p>
In graduate school, I took up lifting weights as a nice contrast to the abstract and cerebral nature of research.  This eventually led me to the sport of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting">powerlifting</a>, which is <a href="http://calloso.com/">well represented in Michigan</a>.  My <a href="https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/markheimann">competitive results</a> can be found via the <a href="https://www.openpowerlifting.org/">Open Powerlifting</a> project.  I also became a USA Powerlifting state referee in 2019 and have refereed multiple powerlifting meets in Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

	I also play a fair amount of music.  I own and play a variety of instruments, of which one of my favorites is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammered_dulcimer">hammered dulcimer</a>. I've played it in a couple of weddings and other <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/michigan-engineering/39917630005/in/photostream/">assorted events</a>, and you can hear a bit of it in an <a href= "https://thetradeoffs.bandcamp.com/">EP</a> some of my talented college friends put together.  At last count I've performed or recorded on five musical instruments.

	I enjoy cooking and baking, mainly because I prefer hobbies to chores and when I reached adulthood I realized that feeding myself would have to become one of those two things.
