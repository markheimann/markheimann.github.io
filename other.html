Outside of computer science I have the chance to participate in many activitites.  I am thankful for the lessons I've learned, the memorable experiences I've had, and the gracious and talented people I have come to know through each of them.

I am an <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/card.phtml?event=2028441">International Master</a>, one of the highest titles awarded in chess.  Over the course of my competitive career, I have won several national scholastic championships and state open championships, as well as national collegiate team championships from my years playing chess for the WUSTL and U of M collegiate chess teams.  In the 2018 and 2019 <a href="https://www.prochessleague.com/">PRO Chess League</a> seasons, I played for the <a href="https://www.prochessleague.com/pittsburgh-pawngrabbers.html">Pittsburgh Pawngrabbers</a>; our team made the playoffs in 2018.  In 2020, I also played first board for the Michigan team that made it to the finals of the inaugural online <a href="https://stateschesscup.wordpress.com/">States Chess Cup</a>.  For several years I also taught chess in private and group lessons, organizing intensive chess camps as well as after-school programs.

Two years later, Florida State University's first board scored a large individual upset over me in the first round of Pan Ams and wrote an <a href="http://www.uschess.org/content/view/12899/735">article for US Chess</a> about it...you can't win 'em all :) congratulations to him on a well-deserved victory. 
	<li>US Chess News <a href="https://new.uschess.org/news/states-chess-cup-playoffs">coverage</a> of the 2020 States Chess Cup playoffs, including my annotations of two games I played (one was another upset loss in the finals :) although the other allowed us to advance in the playoffs)

	</ul>

I am also an occasional chess writer, having published in the United States Chess Federation's <i>Chess Life</i> magazine.
<ul>
<li>An <a href="papers/general/2022CL_chess_im_norm.pdf">article</a> I wrote about achieving my first norm toward the international master title as a non-career chess player. <em>Nominated for "Best Personal Narrative" award by Chess Journalists of America.</em>
        <li>Coverage of the <a href="papers/general/2023CL_chess_usatn.pdf">2023 US Amateur Team North Championship</a>, where I and a team of several University of Michigan alums competed in 2023.

<h2>Powerlifting</h2>
<p>
<img src="assets/fun_figs/lifting-deadlift.jpg" align="right" style="width:200px;height:164px;" hspace="10">
In graduate school, I took up lifting weights as a nice contrast to the abstract and cerebral nature of research.  This eventually led me to the sport of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting">powerlifting</a>.  
</p>
<p>
I have qualified for the USA Powerlifting open division national championships multiple years (in 2022, I competed in it simultaneously with the historic National Open chess tournament, coincidentally held down the hall!), and as of 2023 my <a href="https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/markheimann">competitive results</a> rank in the top 2% of raw, drug-tested male powerlifters worldwide according to the <a href="https://www.openpowerlifting.org/">Open Powerlifting</a> project.  I also am a national referee and have refereed multiple state and national powerlifting championships.

	I also play a fair amount of music.  I own and play a variety of instruments, of which one of my favorites is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammered_dulcimer">hammered dulcimer</a>. I've played it in a couple of weddings and other <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/michigan-engineering/39917630005/in/photostream/">assorted events</a>, and you can hear a bit of it in an <a href= "https://thetradeoffs.bandcamp.com/">EP</a> some of my talented college friends put together.  At last count I've performed or recorded on five musical instruments.  
</p>

<p>
	I enjoy cooking and baking, mainly because I prefer hobbies to chores and when I reached adulthood I realized that feeding myself would have to become one of those two things.
