Outside of computer science I have the chance to participate in many activitites.  I am thankful for the lessons I've learned, the memorable experiences I've had, and the gracious and talented people I have come to know through each of them.

I am also an occasional chess writer, having published in the United States Chess Federation's <i>Chess Life</i> magazine.
<ul>
<li>An <a href="papers/general/2022CL_chess_im_norm.pdf">article</a> I wrote about achieving my first norm toward the international master title as a non-career chess player. <em>Nominated for "Best Personal Narrative" award by Chess Journalists of America.</em>

From time to time, I also work with students, give talks, or play exhibition matches. 

<h2>Powerlifting</h2>
<p>
<img src="assets/fun_figs/lifting-deadlift.jpg" align="right" style="width:200px;height:164px;" hspace="10">
In graduate school, I took up lifting weights as a nice contrast to the abstract and cerebral nature of research.  This eventually led me to the sport of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting">powerlifting</a>.  
</p>
<p>
I have qualified for the USA Powerlifting open division national championships multiple years (in 2022, I competed in it simultaneously with the historic National Open chess tournament, coincidentally held down the hall!), and as of 2023 my <a href="https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/markheimann">competitive results</a> rank in the top 2% of raw, drug-tested male powerlifters worldwide according to the <a href="https://www.openpowerlifting.org/">Open Powerlifting</a> project.  In 2025, I finished third at the California state championship by the bodyweight-adjusted strength formula used to rank powerlifters. 

I also am a national referee and have refereed multiple state and national powerlifting championships.

	I also play a fair amount of music.  I own and play a variety of instruments, of which one of my favorites is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammered_dulcimer">hammered dulcimer</a>. I've played it in a couple of weddings and other <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/michigan-engineering/39917630005/in/photostream/">assorted events</a>, and you can hear a bit of it in an <a href= "https://thetradeoffs.bandcamp.com/">EP</a> some of my talented college friends put together.  At last count I've performed or recorded on five musical instruments.  
</p>

<p>
	I enjoy cooking and baking, mainly because I prefer hobbies to chores and when I reached adulthood I realized that feeding myself would have to become one of those two things.
