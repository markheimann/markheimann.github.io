    I enjoy trying as well as seriously pursuing a variety of activities.  If you want a general idea but don't want to read my rambling account of all of them, you can take a look a short and better-written <a href="http://www.studlife.com/scene/profile/2014/02/27/a-man-of-many-talents-mark-heimanns-intensive-quest-to-conquer-everything-wash-u-has-to-offer/">account</a> from Wash U's student newspaper.  (Picked up by <a href="http://web.chessdailynews.com/a-man-of-many-talents/">Chess Daily News</a> too!)  Since it's from 2014, it doesn't capture many of my more recent interests, but I learned from it that I have wonderful friends.  This has been true throughout my life--at Wash U, the University of Michigan, and beyond: I've been incredibly privileged to have great family, friends, and mentors, and there is no way I'd have made it nearly as far in any of the professional or extracurricular pursuits I've enjoyed without their inspiration, guidance, and support.

	I started playing competitive chess when I was seven years old.  I won the national championship for my age in 2001-2003 and 2005-2006. In fourth grade, my twin brother Alex and I co-won the national championship, and also won the national elementary school championship for bughouse, a zany two-person version of chess.  We qualified for the honorary All-American chess team most years growing up, where in the short bios we had to submit, we had the distinction one year of being the only kids to list "fishing" as a hobby.  (In subsequent years, my brother would have the further distinction of listing "climbing trees" and "chasing toads."  I admit that I too enjoyed both of those activities as a child...)

	When I turned thirteen, I earned the National Master title and began playing exclusively in open tournaments.  I won the Pennsylvania state championship in 2006 and 2009, and tied for or finished first in the Ohio state championship as a nonresident in 2006-2008.  More recently, I won the Michigan Speed Chess Championship in 2016 and finished in clear first in the highest Master/Expert division at the Michigan Class Championship in 2017.

	In college, I represented the Washington University in St. Louis chess team as the first board at the Pan-American Intercollegiate Team Championship all four years of my undergraduate career.  In 2012, my sophomore year, we won the top Division II team award.  I also played for the University of Michigan's team in 2016 as the third board (we are fortunate to have the outstanding international masters Atulya Shetty and Safal Bora on boards one and two.)

	These days I hold the titles of USCF Senior Master and FIDE Master, the highest rating-based national and international titles, respectively.  I try to play in at least a few large tournaments a year, preferably if I can play with or visit friends at the same time.  While St. Louis, where I did my undergraduate study, may be the <a href="http://www.uschess.org/content/view/12658/763/">official chess capital</a>, Michigan is an outstanding place to play chess, and I've greatly enjoyed connecting with extremely strong players in the Michigan chess scene.

	I also enjoy teaching chess.  In high school and college, I taught chess as a as a private instructor and as a volunteer in schools in Pittsburgh and St. Louis.  Thanks to a friend I met in the Michigan chess scene, I have just begun to get involved again in Michigan, and am incredibly excited about it!  I can certainly attest to the benefits of the game, including mental skills, confidence, and of course access to a group of unique and incredibly intelligent individuals.  Relatedly, it is a privilege for me to witness the growth of chess among younger players across the country, so many of whom have advanced at meteoric rates far beyond my own and have broken all the records within my own comparatively short lifetime.

	I've played music most of my life, starting with classical piano when I was six (I do enjoy classical music, though my technique and repertoire would never have been sufficient to impress leading practitioners of the field, and my approach to college freshman-level music theory was to use my perfect pitch to fudge the ear training and wing the rest of it.)  In high school, I began researching, buying and selling, and teaching myself how to play additional musical instruments, ranging from the well-known to the obscure.  One of my favorite instruments, and one for which I've gained some (informal) notoriety, is the <a href="https://manufacturing.dustystrings.com/hammered-dulcimers">hammered dulcimer</a>.  I enjoy many styles of music and can be found attempting to keep up with <a href="https://www.detroitirishmusic.org/">Irish traditional music sessions</a> in the area or collaborating with the <a href="https://smtd.umich.edu/departments/pat/">Performing Arts Technology</a> department at the University of Michigan to hack the bells in the bell tower.

    In the summer of 2014, I decided to learn how to cook more seriously, a) because I figured that since it was looking like I'd have to spend a lot of time in my life feeding myself, I had better make it a hobby rather than a chore, and b) to prove to my mom I wasn't completely helpless in the kitchen.  I especially enjoy baking, pastries in particular.  I also enjoy exploring the flavors and culinary techniques of a variety of cuisines, but especially Chinese food, since like I said I had to prove myself to my Chinese mother!

    I took up weight lifting in the summer of 2015, after my good friend Shane, a strongman champion and clearly inspirational figure, finally helped me overcome my intimidation of the weight room right before I graduated college.  I had about the experience and skill level one might expect from a pastry-baking, folk-music-playing chess nerd (that's right: zero), but I will say that the physical nature and tangible progress of weight lifting is a great complement to research, and I'm happy to report that I've kept at it!  I have a long way to go, but I've been thrilled to see myself get stronger and lift weights I didn't even know were humanly possible to move just a few years ago.  (Not to worry, I'm still far short of the raw, drug-tested world records that even in my fairly diminuitive weight class are insanely high.)  As of summer 2017, I've begun to try my hand at <a href="http://usapl.liftingdatabase.com/lifters-view?id=40429">powerlifting competitions</a>.  I'm fortunate that the <a href="http://usaplmi.com/">USA Powerlifting Michigan branch</a> is extremely active, and the community as I've been exposed to it is nothing but well-run and overwhelmingly supportive even to newbies like me.
